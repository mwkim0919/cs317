=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
The video looks like it is being fast-forwarded from time to time. Maybe there are packets that has not been received.

* FUNKY B
The video looks like it is being fast-forwarded from time to time. Maybe there are missing packets. 

* FUNKY C
The video looks like it is going back and forth from time to time. Maybe packets are received out of order.

* FUNKY D
The video looks like it is going back and forth from time to time and the video is not played fluently.
Maybe packets are received not in order and there might be missing packets as well.

* FUNKY E
The video is fast-forwarded.
Maybe too many packets are processed at once.

* FUNKY F
The video is played in a slow-motion. 
Maybe packets are received not on time meaning they are coming late.

* FUNKY G
The video is played in a slow-motion and the video is not played fluently.
Maybe packets are received not on time meaning they are coming late and some of the packets may be missing.

* FUNKY H
The video gets chopped in the middle. 
Maybe a huge number of packets is lost at once at a certain point of time.

=== Result of analysis ===

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A
There is a frequent packet loss.
The rate of packet being received is 23.05 packet/sec and the rate of packet loss is 2.62 packet/sec
===Possible explanation===
The router is having consistent congestion problem and it decided to drop all packets in its queue.


* FUNKY B
There is a packet loss more frequently than FUNKY A server.
The rate of packet being received is 15.67 packet/sec and the rate of packet loss is 9.44 packet/sec
===Possible explanation===
The router is having consistent congestion problem and it decided to drop all packets in its queue.


* FUNKY C
The packets are not coming in order and there is no packet loss.
The rate of packet being received is 25.02 packet/sec.
The frequency of packets that are not in order is 0.009
===Possible explanation===
Packets might be taking different route, causing them to arrive in different order.


* FUNKY D
The packets are not coming in order and there is packet loss as well.
The rate of packet being received is 13.68 packet/sec and the rate of packet loss is 11.37 packet/sec.
The frequency of packets that are not in order is 0.013
===Possible explanation===
Packets might be taking different route, causing them to arrive in different order.
The router is having consistent congestion problem and it decided to drop all packets in its queue.


* FUNKY E
There is a burst of packets sent from the server.
The rate of packet being received is 47.67 packet/sec and the rate of packet loss is 52.05 packet/sec.
===Possible explanation===
The incoming packets are processed faster than the speed that the movie should be played at.
The router is having consistent congestion problem and it decided to drop all packets in its queue.


* FUNKY F
The incoming packets are received slower than the speed that the movie should be played at.
The rate of packet being received is 10.02 packet/sec and there is no packet loss.
===Possible explanation===
Each packet has been queued for a certain period of time at a router before it is received and then processed.


* FUNKY G
The incoming packets are received slower than the speed that the movie should be played at and some of the packets are lost.
The rate of packet being received is 8.14 packet/sec and the rate of packet loss is 1.88 packet/sec.
===Possible explanation===
Each packet has been queued for a certain period of time at a router before it is received and then processed.
The router is having consistent congestion problem and it decided to drop all packets in its queue.


* FUNKY H
The packet loss is not as frequent as FUNKY A or FUNKY B server however there is large number of packets lost at once.
The rate of packet being received is 21.60 packet/sec and the rate of packet loss is 3.46 packet/sec.
===Possible explanation===
The router is having consistent congestion problem and it decided to drop all packets in its queue.
Another explanation can be, a large number of packets is lost at once. A large number of packets may have been queued and dropped. 
After the router queue has been cleared, the router will send each of the packets at a consistent rate.
